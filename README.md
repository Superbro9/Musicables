# Musicables
This Github repository leverages Apple's new ShazamKit framework to make an app for ios and WatchOS to identify songs.
# To Do
I plan to add the ability to share the apple music link via Qr code, this is partially implemented however Ui needs to be done.
I also plan to use the [Odesli](https://www.notion.so/API-d0ebe08a5e304a55928405eb682f6741) to convert the music link to spotify and other major platforms.
# Note
You need a paid apple developer account in order to test this app.
